# Restarting the Rethinking course again

I've been following the statistical rethinking course on and off for couple of years, now might be a good time to finally really dive deep into the material and especially the exercises. Cool thing about the book is that nowadays you can find not just the R examples, but also versions in pyMC, TensorFlow Probability and even Numpyro/Jax!

It seems Jax support for Windows is still not there, so going to work with R and PyMC on my Windows office, and in the other room I'll setup a Numpyro/Jax version in Linux.
