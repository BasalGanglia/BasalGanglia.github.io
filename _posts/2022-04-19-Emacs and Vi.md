# Moving to Vi

I've been Emacs enthusiast for quite some years (decades?) but I've noticed that in the container world, Vi is much more handy as it comes pre-installed, while installing emacs to containers is quite a pain.

Watching now an interesting Vi tutorial <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZ4p-saaQkc> and will start practicing it later.

Also in the plans is to combine Vi with tmux for maximum productivity.
