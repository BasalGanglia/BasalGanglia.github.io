# MLFlow and Feature stores for Physiological Computing

I'm exploring the idea of implementing my plan for five layer psychophysiological data where each layer is separated by proper feature store. I start by studying MLFlow which is nicely integrated with both Azure and Databricks.

## One Docker lunch

### Multi-stage docker file example

FROM diamol/base AS build-stage
RUN echo 'Building...' > /build.txt

FROM diamol/base AS test-stage
COPY --from=build-stage /build.txt /build.txt
RUN echo 'Testing...' >> build.txt

FROM diamol/base
COPY --from=test-stage /build.txt /build.txt
CMD cat /build.txt

Each stage starts with FROM and the output will be a single Docker image with the contents of the final stage.
