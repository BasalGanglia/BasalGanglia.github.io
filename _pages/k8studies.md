# K8 studies start ! 
##  2022-02-13 17:59:33

Reading the Kubernetes book by Nigel Poulton. I've also have it as an audiobook from Audible, simply to reinforce the concepts using multiple sensory modalities.

To kickstart my Sunday study, I took some usual acetyl-l-carnitine, but in addition to that, today I also took my fish oil early so that I can try out the "daily nootropic capsules" I bought from Bulk that have instructions to be taken with food. So, fish oil and some flaxseed will have to do for "Food". And of course there is a need for proper study music: today decided to go with Worakls. Anyways, back to k8!
